# Discussion and actions

We discussed many problems in the dissertation, and agreed on the feedback. In the next weeks I should fix these problems and finish the rest part. Problems include

-    figures and tablesâ€™ format and representation
-   Contents in background and analysis

We also found some more data and analysis is needed. I will run some more experiments to obtain more accurate results
