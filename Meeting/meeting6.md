    -   structures
    -   Finished chapters: 3 and 4
-   Some bug and questions encountered when using Cirrus
-   Scaling-up experiment details and results

    -   two interesting things

    -   1.  Under same settings and big population size, the total required sampling numbers have high variance. Some run has 300,000 total sampling tries, but some other run has 1,500,000.
        2.  Also, the total sampling size is not ‘highly’ proportional to the execution time. Some run has more sampling tries but less time cost.
-   Profiling results
-   Details in the possible experiments using exact inference
